                            If you don’t reverse the curse, you’ll stay animals forever!

                            ogre minions in her favorite game: dodgeball. It will be hard to play with paws

                            -- and destroy this evil witch in the process.

                                You are playing dodgeball. Your teammates and opponents are AI. You can only move around
                                your side of the dodgeball court.
                                If you cross the middle line dividing the court, you will be eliminated. Stay on your
                                side.
                                Your goal is to eliminate all your opponent players. You must pick up dodgeballs and
                                throw them at your opponents. Opponents can only be eliminated if you or your teammates
                                get them out with a ball.
                                Some dodgeballs eliminate players when hit; other balls not only eliminate players, but
                                also hinder the other players around them.
                                Airborne balls are considered “live” and dangerous. Balls mid-bounce are considered
                                live.
                                Balls that are rolling on the ground or in a person’s hand are inert and will pose no
                                danger.
                                You will be eliminated if you are hit by your opponents’ balls (depending on their
                                damage type).
                                Friendly-fire is on. You are able to hit and eliminate your teammates, and vice versa.
                                If you are eliminated by any means, it’s game over.
                                <br /><br />
                                There are three types of balls. Normal, Ice, and Fire. Ice will freeze players in a
                                large radius. Fire will blow up
                                and kill players within a smaller radius.
                                <br /><br />
                                There are "intelligent" opponents and teammates that move on their own and will throw at
                                you
                                your other opponents. If you die, you will take over one of your teammates bodies until
                                the game is over.
