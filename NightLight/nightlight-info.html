                            In the middle of a dark, stormy night, you hear a
                            loud crash and a scream from your mother’s room.
                            Worried, you leave the comfort of your bed to go and check on her.
                            But as you go, the storm knocks the power out, and everything goes dark!

                        <span>
                            <p>In this platformer, you will dodge environmental hazards and use
                                light to solve puzzles so you may reach the end of each level. As
                                an added layer of difficulty, you must move your character while
                                cast in darkness -- “blinded.” When you are in the dark, these
                                imaginatory monsters will get closer to you. You must use a
                                flashlight tool that will allow you to see nearby hazards and
                                platforms, and also kill lurking monsters -- but for each level,
                                you have limited juice for your flashlight!
                                <br /><br />
                                The main mechanic is the play with light in the game. You can turn off the light to
                                go through walls, kills monsters by shining the light on them, and more. The light
                                follows the
                                cursor and you use WASD and space to move about.
                                <br /><br />
                                There are many different traps we developed: thwomps, wrecking ball, falling ball,
                                spikes, sawblade, pitfall, dark wall, monsters, and darkness. Designing this many traps
                                in the limited time we had proved to be a challenge.
                                <br /><br />
                                We also played with sound cues in the game and have spacial sound that tracks the player
                                and will increase in volume as the player gets closer.
                                <br /><br />
                                There is a final boss battle where established traps
                                were implemented throughout the obstacle course, similar to a
                                bullet hell concept but re-utilizing the player’s learned movement + evasion
                                mechanics. The boss battle happens in 4 stages: each stage has a unique trap design,
                                and each stage requires the player to shine their flashlight on the head of the boss.
                                When
                                the player damages the boss a fourth and final time, they win! An end-game screen
                                will congratulate the player.
