# Web Development

This Github project is to showcase the games that Olly Lance developed in 53-471 (Game Design, Prototyping, and Production). This class focuses on "rapid prototyping and iterative design, and common methods of project management for creative software development."

## Description

In 53-471 (Game Design, Prototyping, and Production), Olly Lance worked as one of the lead coders. He developed 3 different and unique games in Unity with 4 other individuals: Miheer Lele, Daniel Moon, Suzi Shultz, Yang Bai. In the class, every few weeks, the team remotely met deadlines for documentation, presentation, and developing. We went through alpha, beta and final versions and were graded on our effort and final game.
