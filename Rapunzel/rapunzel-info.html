                        <h2>Rapunzel</h2>
                        <span>You play a prince who is smitten with Rapunzel, who is waiting for you to rescue her. But
                            as you play, the dialogue reveals
                            hesitation from the prince, who keeps saying he will save her “next time.”
                            Each level, you will scale Rapunzel’s tower, using her golden locks as ropes.
                            But as you climb, you must dodge numerous hazards that’ll knock you back down the tower. At
                            the end of each
                            level, you and Rapunzel spend a romantic night together, only for the prince to leave
                            thereafter. After this repeats for several levels, the end of the game shows a fed-up
                            Rapunzel kicking you, the prince, down from the tower, for good. </span>

                        <span>
                            <p>In this project we were tasked with creating a game where the only restriction was
                                that it had to be related to a Fairy Tale. We brainstormed many ideas but fell into
                                a climbing game where the prince needs to climb up Rapunzel's hair and dodge scissors
                                that cut her hair, birds, and other obstacles.
                                <br /><br />
                                Once the idea was settled, we needed the core mechanics and we didn't know how it would
                                work.
                                I came up with this idea of a 2D sprite in a 3D world. I wanted the sprite to rotate
                                around
                                the castle and to do this, I ended up just rotating the entire world and keeping the
                                player
                                in place. It makes a really cool effect.
                                <br /><br />
                                There are 4 different levels in this game, each with increasing difficulty. Each level
                                is in a
                                different season and we add some humor into the dialoge.
                                <br /><br />
                                Other notable mechanics: checkpoints, progress map on the left side, sheild, and a speed
                                boost.

                            <p>I learned that coders can be artists and artists
                                can be coders and sometimes getting a new perspective on that can really bring
                                the game to life.
